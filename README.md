  I created basic quiz application. It features javascript functions that interract with the users choices. There is a 60 second timer, with 10 second penalties for incorect choices. The application scores the quiz and displays your score at the end, with an option to add your initials. This data is stored in local storage and dispalyed on a seperate page that can be navigated to and from </p>
